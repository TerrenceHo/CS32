MyMap
associate(): If the map contains N items, the average Big-O of associate is O(log(N))

find(): if the map contains N items, then the average Big-O of find() is O(log(N))

-------------------
AttractionMapper
init(): If the Map has N street segments, and there are S attractions spread out, then the Big-O of the function is O(N + Slog(S))

getGeoCoord(): If N is the number of attractions in the attraction map, the Big-O of the function is O(log(N))

-------------------
SegmentMapper
init(): If N is the number of segments, and there are S total attractions, then the Big-O of the function is O((N+S) * log(N+S))

getSegments():If N is the number of street segments in your Segment Map and S is the number of total attractions, then the Big-O of the function is O(log(N + S))

-------------------
Navigator
navigate(): If N is the total number of segments, and S is the average number of attractions per street segment, and P is the number of locations processed while finding the optimal path, then the Big-O of the function is O(P * (log(N + S) + P))
